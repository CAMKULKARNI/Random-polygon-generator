# Random-polygon-generator
A python script that generates random looking polygons given the number of edges/vertices using the von mises randomness.

The notebook randomPolygonGenerator generates the edges randomly, whereas the notebook buildingsAndCultivatedLand generates polygons that look a bit more organised.
